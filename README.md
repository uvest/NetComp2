# NetComp2 v0.0.1

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/peterewills/NetComp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peterewills/NetComp)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/peterewills/NetComp/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/peterewills/NetComp)
 
NetComp is a Python library implementing various algorithms for comparison of networks. A network is a collection of nodes and edges, also known as a graph.

THIS IS A FORK FROM THE [ORIGINAL NETCOMP](https://github.com/peterewills/NetComp) REPOSITORY BY PETER WILLS. THIS FORK SIMPLY UPDATED THE API TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH networkx >= 3.<br>

## Installation

Local installation:

1. Clone locally
2. Install locally with pip

```bash
python -m pip install -e ./NetComp2
```
 
<!-- To install NetComp, do

	pip install netcomp -->
 
## Usage

Although many common packages, such as [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) treat graphs as fundamental objects, this package treats the adjacency matrix as the object of interest. In this usage example, we will use NetworkX to generate our graphs, then transform them to adjacency matrices before using NetComp

	>> import networkx as nx
	>> import netcomp as nc
	>> G1,G2 = [nx.erdos_renyi_graph(10,1/2) for _ in range(2)] # 2 random graphs
	>> A1,A2 = [nx.adjacency_matrix(G) for G in [G1,G2]]
	>> nc.lambda_dist(A1,A2,kind='laplacian',k=10)
